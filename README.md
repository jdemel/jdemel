## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my profile page

My name is Johannes Demel. I'm currently with [Dedrone by Axon](https://www.dedrone.com/), writing DSP to detect drones. Before that I pursued my my PhD in Communications Engineering ðŸ“¡ with the [Department of Communications Engineering](https://www.ant.uni-bremen.de) at the [University of Bremen](https://uni-bremen.de). My dissertation [Software radio systems engineering for URLLC Industrie 4.0 applications](https://doi.org/10.26092/elib/3483) is available online. Besides, I'm a [GNU Radio](https://gnuradio.org) user and developer. Together with [Michael Dickens](https://github.com/michaelld), we maintain the [Vector-Optimized Library of Kernels (VOLK)](https://libvolk.org).


- ðŸ”­ I finished my PhD thesis ðŸ“• [Software radio systems engineering for URLLC Industrie 4.0 applications](https://doi.org/10.26092/elib/3483) which includes a GNU Radio demo where [AGVs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_guided_vehicle) ðŸ¤– use our communication system for ultra reliable low latency communication.
